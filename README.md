**PROJECT : WHEATHER FORECAST**

Objective:- Predicting wheather using ML models
Research:-
The goal of wheather forecast software is to alert the users about the climate situation based on the different parameters like humidity, temperature,
Drought is one of the natural disaster. It is a deficiency of
precipitation over an extended period of time, resulting in a water
shortage.  It is a continuous period of dry weather, when an area gets
less than its normal amount of rain, over months or over years.
Droughts can become dangerous to people and other land animals causing
famine and even creating desserts. And it is difficult to decide when a
drought started and some times when it ends too.
Many people die every year in famines due to drought in subsistence
farming areas. A drought exists when the average annual rainfall is less
than 75% of the Normal Analysis of less rainfall areas and water
scarcity areas is the important element of the task .And we will be
training the machine with the data for now and later for the future we
will be using ML algorithm for future prediction
This project visualizes the drought areas in India which helps in
designing drought prediction  models,contributing to loss reduction.
Methodology:-
We are going to take the previous water data, pollution data in mainly
states of Telangana. We will train the model with the previous data, and
then we are going to predict the future.
TECH STACK :-
• Python
• Pandas
• Numpy
• Seaborn
• Matplotlib
• Scikit learn
• HTML5 & CSS
Conclusion:-
Development of a software for wheather forecast.
